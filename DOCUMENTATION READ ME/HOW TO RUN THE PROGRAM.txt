1- Download and install XAMPP or any other server;
2- Run it and start Apache and MySQL;
3- Move this folder(project folder) in C:/Xampp/htdocs
4- Open the CMD (windows) in the folder (it s going to be something like  C:/Xampp/htdocs/VDC_folder )
5- type in the CMD  the following line :   

	composer install

6-create empty database in Mysql  with the following line and dont create any table it has to be empty:

	CREATE DATABASE vdc_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;


6- search in the VDC_folder the file called:   

	.env.example 

Make a copy of it and rename it without .example, as: 

	.env      

7- open the .env file and search those strings

	DB_CONNECTION=mysql
	DB_HOST=TO_SET_UP
	DB_PORT=TO_SET_UP
	DB_DATABASE=TO_SET_UP
	DB_USERNAME=TO_SET_UP
	DB_PASSWORD=TO_SET_UP

8- modify them to: 

	DB_CONNECTION=mysql
	DB_HOST= localhost  (to work in local)
	DB_PORT=3306
	DB_DATABASE=vdc_db  (or the name that you chose for the database in mysql)
	DB_USERNAME=root  (or your name in the db)
	DB_PASSWORD=   (empty default, or the password you have in your db)

9- again in the CMD (allways on C:/Xampp/htdocs/VDC_folder) type

	php artisan key:generate

10- Now lets create the tables into the database, type in the CMD:

	php artisan migrate --force

11-RUn the app !!! again in the CMD:

	php artisan serve

it will return a string with the url where the app is running in the server (usualy http://127.0.0.1:8000/);

Copy it in the browser, Enjoy !
